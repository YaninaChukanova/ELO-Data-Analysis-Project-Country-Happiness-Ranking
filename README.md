# Country Happiness Ranking Research

## Overview

The project "Country Happiness Ranking Research" is aimed at identifying factors that influence the level of happiness of the population in different countries and understanding the dynamics of this phenomenon over time. By analyzing various social, economic, cultural and political factors, the project aims to identify the key influential variables that determine the level of happiness of countries. Based on the data and results of the study, recommendations can be developed to improve social policy, economic development and other areas aimed at improving the quality of life of the population and creating favorable conditions for its development.

## <font color="blue">Identification of the problem</font>

### **Research questions**:
*	What factors are most correlated with the overall level of happiness in countries?
*	Is there a link between economic indicators (e.g., GDP per capita) and happiness?
*	Is there a relationship between social indicators (e.g., trust) and happiness?
*	What is the impact of quality of life (e.g., access to education and health care) on overall happiness?
*	Is it possible to predict the level of happiness of countries using machine learning models based on various factors?

Researching these questions can help to better understand what factors influence the happiness of the population of countries and how this knowledge can be used to improve the quality of life.

### Non-Technical Explanation of Domain Modeling

In this project, domain modeling is like creating a map to help us navigate the complex landscape of global happiness levels. It's a visual guide, like a map, that helps us understand how economic prosperity, social support systems, health indicators, and personal freedoms influence the happiness of people in different parts of the world.

###  Data Collection and Cleaning Scripts

For transparency and replication, I provide all scripts for data collection and cleaning, covering the entire process, including data partitioning.

### Research Work
Engaged in Data Science research, I focus on identifying deep patterns and trends that shed light on what makes people happy around the world. Through rigorous analysis and innovative approaches, I aim to make a significant contribution to understanding and promoting happiness around the world.
