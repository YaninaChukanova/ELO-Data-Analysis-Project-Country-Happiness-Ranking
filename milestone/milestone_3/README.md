# Data Analysis using CSV Files

## Description

This project involves the analysis of data from  CSV file containing information 

## Used File:
1. ** Data_for_Project:** [`Data_for_Project.csv`](../../data/Data_for_Project.csv)

   - Structure: Country name, Ladder score, Logged GDP per capita, Social support, Healthy life expectancy, Freedom Index, The World Giving Index, Corruption Perceptions Index. 


## Technical Explanation of Findings:

  The analysis involved several steps to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the data and its implications:

1. **Preliminary Data Analysis**

   - Loading and Checking Data:
**Data_for_Project:** [`Data_for_Project.csv`](../../data/Data_for_Project.csv)  
# Load the cleaned CSV file
cleaned_file_path = "../../data/Cleaned_Data_for_Project.csv"
df1 = pd.read_csv(cleaned_file_path, delimiter=';')

   - Structure: Country name, Ladder score, Logged GDP per capita, Social support, Healthy life expectancy, Freedom Index, The World Giving Index, Corruption Perceptions Index.  Initial data import and inspection to ensure correctness and completeness.

   - Data Cleaning: Addressing missing values and anomalies to prepare the dataset for analysis.

   - First Data Review: Basic statistical characteristics and a check for missing values to understand data distribution.

2. **Correlation Study**
